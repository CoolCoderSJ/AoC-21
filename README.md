# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for AoC 2021. Each day has a separate folder.

My file structure might slowly start to include custom debugger files. For example, Day 11 uses a custom built debugger that visualizes the current coordinate system. To try it out, uncomment line 71.

#### Beware, these are pretty sloppy solutions.
